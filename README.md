# MarkItUp

This is a fork of [MarkItDown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown).

While markitup is a useful tool, its returned content is too text-focused, which is not updated to the current rise of multi-modal LLMs.

## Features

We plan to return an OpenAI compatible response, which can be used by most LLM clients.
